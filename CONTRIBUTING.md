## Pull requests
I do not accept AI-generated code such as GitHub Copilot, as long as there are licensing issues...!

Specifically, what I am concerned about is "outputting the exact same code as
(non-public domain) existing source code but not following the license of that code".

For example, it is possible to learn source code licensed under a license that
requires attribution and output the same code as the original without attribution.
I am concerned that this could result in the use of licensed code without following the license,
in other words, violating the license.

Therefore, I don't consider it is a problem if the output complies with the license (or is
derived from 100% of the public domain).

Example: There is a program Foo, licensed under the MIT/Expat license.
When learning it and outputting the same code as the program...
* If the output includes a copyright notice and a permission notice under the MIT/Expat license in accordance with the license, this is not a problem.
* If the output does not comply with the license, this is a problem.

However, if it is incompatible with the repository's license, it is not acceptable.
For example, suppose a repository is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
Merging code licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 into it is not allowed because the license conflicts.
